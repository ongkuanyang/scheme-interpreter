This is a Scheme interpreter inspired by the paper "Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters" and the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".

The use of monad transformers allows for the abstracting away of error and environment handling from the eval function. :)


Test command:
> test (App (Lambda ["x"] (App (Prim add) [Var "x", Var "x"])) [Num 2])
